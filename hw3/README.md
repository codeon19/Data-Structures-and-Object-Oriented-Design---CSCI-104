# HW3

# CS 104 Student Repository

This HW assignment contains a calculator that uses a stack to parse through various
lines of a file that contain math statements. The parser needed to account for
all the various edge cases involved with the syntax of a calculator.

Files
- arithmetic.cpp contains the code for the actual parsing
- llisttest.cpp contains a gtest for llistint.cpp
- stacktest.cpp contains a gtest for stackint.cpp
- hw3q5.txt contains test cases for arithmetic.cpp

Compile
- arithmetic currently in the makefile
- llisttest and stacktest are currently commented out and need to be uncommented for their respective executables to be created
